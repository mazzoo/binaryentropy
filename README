usage
~~~~~

  usage:
          binaryentropy image

          dumps the entropy of image
          the output is created by sweeping a 256-byte sliding window over image
          and may be used by e.g. gnuplot to visualize

          e.g.:
                  $ binaryentropy image > entropy_of_image.gnuplot
                  $ gnuplot
                  gnuplot> plot "entropy_of_image.gnuplot"

          or in one line, you may
                  $ IMAGE=/bin/ls make plot
